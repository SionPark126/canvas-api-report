# Working with Canvas API

This repository contains some of the works that I did for Educational Technology & Media Department at SPU. 

Most of the codes are in server.js. I used them to generate reports, pull data that isn't provided in Canvas service via UI, and automate crosslisting courses for professors. 

Tokens are stored locally using dotenv and using asynchronous calls I was to able to make several API calls to get the desired results. 

* crosslist-courses folder contains functions that make api calls to get necessary information such as getting instructors of courses to sort courses and crosslist them automatically. 

* other-reports forler contains functions to coclude courses, delete courses, delete duplicate files, and etc.
